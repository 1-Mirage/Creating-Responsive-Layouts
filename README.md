DAY 1  : Precentage Vs Fixed Width
1) Limit the total width of
   the .intro-conent to about half
   of it's parent
 
2) Stop the text from overflowing
    out the bottom at small screen
    widths
    
DAY 2  : MAX WIDTH
1) Keep the text inside .intro-content
   in the same place, but have the background
   extend from one side of the viewport
   to the other, no matter how wide or narrow
   the browser is.
 
2) Limit the maximum width of the text in the
   bottom area.
